# Plan for Committing the Keycloak-Wazuh Integration Project

Based on my analysis of the project, I'll outline a detailed plan for committing the project in its current state to Git. This plan will ensure that all necessary files are included while respecting the exclusions defined in the `.gitignore` file.

## Current Project Structure

The project is a Keycloak-Wazuh integration for monitoring authentication events with the following components:

- Docker Compose setup for deployment
- Custom decoders and rules for Wazuh
- Configuration for Keycloak, Wazuh, and Syslog-ng
- Comprehensive documentation

## Git Initialization and Commit Plan

### 1. Initialize Git Repository

Since the project doesn't appear to be initialized as a Git repository yet, the first step is to initialize a new Git repository in the project root directory.

```bash
git init
```

### 2. Review Files to be Committed

Based on the `.gitignore` file, the following directories/files will be excluded from version control:

```
.docker
.idea
log
wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs
```

All other files should be included in the commit.

### 3. Stage Files

Stage all files that should be included in the repository:

```bash
git add .
```

This will automatically respect the exclusions defined in the `.gitignore` file.

### 4. Create Initial Commit

Create an initial commit with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit of Keycloak-Wazuh Integration"
```

### 5. Add Remote Repository (Optional)

If you have a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket), add it as a remote:

```bash
git remote add origin <repository-url>
```

### 6. Push to Remote Repository (Optional)

Push the committed changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

For the initial commit and future commits, I recommend following these guidelines:

1. Use a clear, concise subject line (50 characters or less)
2. Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
3. Use the body to explain what and why, not how
4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")

Example commit message for the initial commit:

```
Initial commit of Keycloak-Wazuh Integration

This commit includes:
- Docker Compose setup for Keycloak, Wazuh, and Syslog-ng
- Custom decoders and rules for Wazuh
- Configuration files for all components
- Comprehensive documentation
```

## Future Steps

After the initial commit, you can implement the restructuring plan outlined in the `MIGRATION.md` file. I recommend:

1. Creating a new branch for the restructuring
2. Implementing the changes as described in the migration plan
3. Testing the restructured project
4. Merging the restructuring branch back to the main branch
