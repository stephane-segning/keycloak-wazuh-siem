# Project Restructuring Summary

## What Has Been Done

In Architect mode, we have created the following documentation files:

1. **README.md**: A comprehensive README file that explains the project, its architecture, features, and how to get started.

2. **docs/architecture/README.md**: Detailed documentation about the integration architecture and data flow.

3. **docs/guides/deployment.md**: A guide on how to deploy the Keycloak-Wazuh integration using Docker Compose.

4. **docs/guides/keycloak-configuration.md**: A guide on how to configure Keycloak to send events to Wazuh via Syslog.

5. **docs/guides/wazuh-configuration.md**: A guide on how to configure Wazuh to process and analyze Keycloak events.

6. **docs/examples/README.md**: Examples of how the Keycloak-Wazuh integration can be used in real-world scenarios.

7. **docs/CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for contributing to the project.

8. **docs/MIGRATION.md**: A plan for restructuring the project files.

## What Still Needs to Be Done

Since Architect mode can only edit Markdown files, the actual file restructuring needs to be done in Code mode. The following tasks need to be completed:

1. **Create the directory structure** as outlined in the migration plan.

2. **Move configuration files** to their new locations.

3. **Create script files** for common tasks.

4. **Create a LICENSE file** for the project.

5. **Update the .gitignore file** to exclude appropriate files.

6. **Create GitHub templates** for issues and pull requests.

7. **Create an environment variables example file** for Docker Compose.

8. **Create architecture diagrams** to illustrate the integration.

## Next Steps

1. Switch to Code mode to implement the migration plan:

   ```
   <switch_mode>
   <mode_slug>code</mode_slug>
   <reason>Need to implement the file restructuring plan</reason>
   </switch_mode>
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the migration plan to restructure the project.

3. Test the restructured project to ensure everything works as expected.

4. Consider creating additional documentation or examples as needed.

## Benefits of the New Structure

The new structure provides several benefits:

1. **Better organization**: The project is now organized into logical directories that make it easier to understand and navigate.

2. **Comprehensive documentation**: The documentation now covers all aspects of the project, from architecture to deployment to configuration.

3. **Clear examples**: The examples document provides real-world use cases that demonstrate the value of the integration.

4. **Contribution guidelines**: The contributing document makes it easier for others to contribute to the project.

5. **GitHub integration**: The GitHub templates make it easier to manage issues and pull requests.

This restructuring will make the project more suitable for open source sharing on GitHub and for use in articles and YouTube videos.
